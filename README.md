# PyBer Analysis
## Overview

PyBerâ€™s ride sharing data were reviewed to summarize weekly fares among urban, suburban, and rural cities for approximately a five-month period.  The analysis focused on how fare revenue varies across different types of cities and to show any patterns within the level of fares for each city type.  Conclusions stemming from this analysis are included at the end of this document.
