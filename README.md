# PyBer Analysis
## Overview

PyBer’s ride sharing data were reviewed to summarize weekly fares among urban, suburban, and rural cities for approximately a five-month period.  The analysis focused on how fare revenue varies across different types of cities and to show any patterns within the level of fares for each city type.  Conclusions stemming from this analysis are included at the end of this document.

## Results

The following chart displays the results of the analysis.

The most obvious difference is that weekly fares were highest in urban cities, followed by suburban locations, and then rural areas.  The fares are dependent on several factors: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per rider.  The following table summarizes this information.[^1].

### _Total Rides_
The total number of rides in urban areas is more than twice that for suburban cities.  Further, the number of rides in suburban areas is five times larger the figure than in rural locations..  This pattern is to be expected given that population tends to be higher and denser in urban areas.
### _Total Drivers_
A substantial majority of PyBer’s drivers serve urban areas.. Given that there are more rides in urban areas, there is more opportunity for drivers to schedule rides.  It may not be economical for some drivers to serve areas in which ride demand is low or inconsistent.
### _Total Fares_
Since there are more rides and drivers in urban areas, the total fares are highest in these cities.  Drivers do not need to rely on longer trips in more populated areas to earn a steady revenue stream.
### _Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver_
Although there are fewer opportunities to provide rides in rural and, to some extent, suburban areas, there average fare per ride and per driver are higher in less populated areas.  Riders in these locations likely need to go further distances to reach their destinations whether it be for work, shopping., visiting, etc.  Additionally, public transportation is often lacking in rural areas so ride sharing may be able to fulfill a critical need for those residents who do not have easily access to their own vehicles.

## Conclusions
Based on this analysis, the following recommendations are being made.
- Capitalize on the strong market presence in urban areas.  Ride sharing opportunities in urban areas occur more frequently and consistently.  Ensure that PyBer’s continues to serve this market well.  Regularly poll riders and customers to determine whether PyBer is the go-to choice for drivers and riders alike.
- Monitor trends that are not explicitly captured in the data, such as population growth/loss, availability of alternative transportation methods, including public transportation, and prices of critical inputs, such as gas and car prices.  These factors should be considered as they could impact the demand for rides and the availability of drivers.
- Explore ways to increase presence in rural and suburban areas and incentivize drivers for serving these areas.  While there are fewer people in these locations and, thus, a smaller base to provide rides, the length of the rides may be able to compensate for the sheer volume.  Customers in these areas may not be aware of ride sharing options.  Additional marketing efforts should be considered.  Further, attracting drivers in these locations may become easier if there are more consistent opportunities to provide rides.
